                              <h1>EARLY LIFE</h1>
                                <p>
                                  Michael Philip Jagger was born into a middle-class family in <b>Dartford</b>, Kent on <i>26 July 1943</i>. His father, <b>Basil Fanshawe "Joe" Jagger </b>(<i>13 April 1913 – 11 November 2006</i>), and grandfather <b>David Ernest Jagger</b> were both teachers. His mother,<b> Eva Ensley Mary</b> (née Scutts;<i> 6 April 1913 – 18 May 2000</i>), born in <b>Sydney</b>, Australia, of English descent, was a hairdresser and an active member of the Conservative Party.
                                  Jagger's younger brother,<b> Chris</b> (born <i>19 December 1947</i>), is also a musician. The two have performed together. Although brought up to follow his father's career path, Jagger "was always a singer" as he stated in According to the Rolling Stones. 
                                  "I always sang as a child. I was one of those kids who just liked to sing. Some kids sing in choirs; others like to show off in front of the mirror. I was in the church choir and I also loved listening to singers on the radio–the <b>BBC</b> or <b>Radio Luxembourg</b>–or watching them on TV and in the movies." In <i>September 1950</i>, <b>Keith Richards</b> and Jagger were classmates at <b>Wentworth Primary School</b>, Dartford prior to the Jagger family's <i>1954</i> move to Wilmington,Kent. The same year he passed the eleven-plus and went to Dartford Grammar School, which now has the Mick Jagger Centre, named after its most famous alumnus, installed within the school's site. Jagger and Richards lost contact with each other when they went to different schools, but after a chance encounter on platform two at Dartford railway station in <i>July 1960</i>, resumed their friendship and discovered their shared love of rhythm and blues, which for Jagger had begun with <b>Little Richard</b>. 
                                  Jagger left school in <i>1961</i> after passing seven O-levels and two A-levels. With Richards, he moved into a flat in <b>Edith Grove</b>, Chelsea, London, with guitarist <b>Brian Jones</b>. While Richards and Jones planned to start their own rhythm and blues group, Blues Incorporated, Jagger continued to study business on a government grant as an undergraduate student at the London School of Economics,and had seriously considered becoming either a journalist or a politician, comparing the 
                                  latter to a pop star. Brian Jones, using the name <b>Elmo Lewis</b>, began working at the <b>Ealing Club</b> — where a "loosely knit version" of Blues Incorporated began with Richards. Jagger began to jam with the group, eventually becoming featured singer. Soon, Richards, 
                                  Jones, and Jagger began to practise on their own, laying the foundation for what would become <b>The Rolling Stones</b>.

                                  In their earliest days, <b>the Rolling Stones</b> played for no money in the interval of Alexis Korner's gigs at a basement club opposite Ealing Broadway tube station (subsequently called <b>"Ferry's"</b> club). At the time, the group had very little equipment and needed to borrow Korner's gear to play. The group's first appearance, under the name the Rollin' Stones (after one of their favourite <b>Muddy Waters</b> tunes), was at the <b>Marquee Club</b>, a jazz club, in <b>London</b> on <i>12 July 1962</i>. They would later change their name to "the Rolling Stones" as it seemed more formal. Victor Bockris states that the band members included <b>Jagger</b>, <b>Keith 
                                  Richards</b>, <b>Brian Jones</b>, <b>Ian Stewart</b> on piano, <b>Dick Taylor</b> on bass and <b>Tony Chapman</b> on drums. However, Richards states in his memoir Life that "The drummer that night was <b>Mick Avory</b>−not Tony 
                                  Chapman, as history has mysteriously handed it down..." 
                                  By autumn 1963, Jagger had left the London School of Economics in favour of his promising musical career with the Rolling Stones. The group continued to play songs by American rhythm and blues artists such as <b>Chuck Berry</b> and <b>Bo Diddley</b>, but with the strong encouragement of manager <b>Andrew Loog Oldham</b>, Jagger and Richards soon began to write their own songs. This core songwriting 
                                  partnership took some time to develop; one of their early compositions, <i>"As Tears Go By"</i>, was a song written for <b>Marianne Faithfull</b>, a young 
                                  singer Loog Oldham was promoting at the time. For the Rolling Stones, the duo would write <i>"The Last Time"</i>, the group's third No. 1 single in the UK (their first two UK No. 1 hits had been remakes of songs that had previously been recorded by other artists <i>"It's All Over Now"</i> 
                                  by <b>Bobby Womack</b> and <i>"Little Red Rooster"</i> by <b>Willie Dixon</b>) based on <i>"This May Be the Last Time"</i>, a traditional Negro spiritual song 
                                  recorded by <b>the Staple Singers</b> in <i>1955</i>. Jagger and Richards also wrote their first international hit, <i>"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"</i>. It also established the Rolling Stones' image as defiant troublemakers in 
                                  contrast to the Beatles' "lovable moptop" image.
                                  Jagger in 1965 
                                  Jagger told <b>Stephen Schiff</b> in a <i>1992</i> Vanity Fair profile: "I wasn't trying to be rebellious in those days; I was just being me. I wasn't trying to push the edge of anything. I'm being me and ordinary, the guy from suburbia who sings in this band, but someone older might have thought 
                                  it was just the most awful racket, the most terrible thing, and where are 
                                  we going if this is music?... But all those songs we sang were pretty tame, really. People didn't think they were, but I thought they were 
                                  tame." 
                                  The group released several successful albums, including <i>Out of Our Heads</i>, <i>Aftermath</i> and <i>Between the Buttons</i>, but in their personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy and Richards was sentenced to one year in prison for allowing cannabis to be smoked on his property. The traditionally conservative editor 
                                  of <i>The Times</i>, <b>William Rees-Mogg</b>, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up 
                                  spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.
                                  By the release of the Stones' album <i>Beggars Banquet</i>, Brian Jones was only sporadically contributing to the band. Jagger stated that Jones was 
                                  "not psychologically suited to this way of life". His drug use had become a hindrance, and he was unable to obtain a US visa. Richards reported that, in a June meeting with Jagger, Richards, and Watts at Jones' house, Jones admitted that he was unable to "go on the road again," and left the band, saying "'I've left, and if I want to I can come 
                                  back'". On <i>3 July 1969</i>, less than a month later, Jones drowned under mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool at his home, Cotchford 
                                  Farm, in Hartfield, East Sussex. 
                                  On <i>5 July 1969</i>, two days after Jones' death, the Rolling Stones played a previously scheduled show at Hyde Park, dedicating it as a tribute to him. In front of an estimated 250,000 fans, the Stones performed their 
                                  first gig with their newest guitarist, <b>Mick Taylor</b>. At the beginning of the show, Jagger read an excerpt from Shelley's poem Adonaïs, an elegy written on the death of his friend John Keats, After which they 
                                  released thousands of butterflies in Jones' memory before starting the 
                                  show with a song by <b>Johnny Winter</b>, <i>"I'm Yours and I'm Hers"</i>. During the concert, they included two songs never before heard by the audience from two forthcoming albums, <i>"Midnight Rambler"</i>, <i>"Love in Vain"</i> (<i>Let It Bleed</i> – released <i>December 1969</i>), and <i>"Give Me A 
                                  Drink"</i> (appeared on Exile on Main St. – released <i>May 1972</i>). <i>"Honky Tonk Women"</i>, released the previous day, was also played at the gig .

                                  In <i>1970</i>, Jagger bought <b>"Stargroves"</b>, a manor house and estate in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones and several other bands recorded there using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. 
                                  After Jones' death and their move in <i>1971</i> to the south of France as tax exiles, Jagger, along with the rest of the band, changed his look and 
                                  style as the <i>1970s</i> progressed. He also learned to play guitar and contributed guitar parts for certain songs on <i>Sticky Fingers</i> (<i>1971</i>) and all subsequent albums except <i>Dirty Work</i> in <i>1986</i>. For the Rolling Stones' highly publicised <i>1972 American tour</i>, Jagger wore glam- 
                                  rock clothing and glittery makeup on stage. Later in the decade they ventured into genres like disco and punk with the album <i>Some Girls</i> (<i>1978</i>). However, their interest in the blues had been made 
                                  manifest in the <i>1972</i> album <i>Exile on Main St. Music</i> critic <b>Russell Hall</b> has described Jagger's emotional singing on the gospel- influenced <i>"Let It Loose"</i>, one of the album's tracks, as Jagger's finest- 
                                  ever vocal achievement. 
                                  After the band's acrimonious split with their second manager, <b>Allen Klein</b>, in <i>1971</i>, Jagger took control of their business affairs after speaking with an up-and-coming frontman, <b>J. B. Silver</b>, and has managed them ever since in collaboration with his friend and  colleague, <b>Prince Rupert Loewenstein</b>. <b>Mick Taylor</b>, Jones' replacement, left the band in <i>December 1974</i> and was replaced 
                                  by Faces guitarist <b>Ronnie Wood</b> in <i>1975</i>, who also functioned as a mediator within the group, and between Jagger and Richards in 
                                  particular. 
                                  In <i>1972</i>, <b>Mick Jagger</b>, <b>Charlie Watts</b> and <b>Bill Wyman</b>, in addition to <b>Nicky Hopkins</b> and <b>Ry Cooder</b>, released the album <i>Jamming with Edward!</i>, which was recorded within the Let It Bleed sessions at London's Olympic 
                                  Studio. The album consisted of loose jams while members (reportedly) were waiting for Keith Richards to return to the studio after 
                                  leaving due to an issue over the supporting guitar role of Cooder.

                                  While continuing to tour and release albums with the Rolling Stones, Jagger began a solo career. According to Rolling Stone in their <i>14 February 1985</i> issue, to "establish an artistic identity for himself apart from the Rolling Stones" in what the magazine called his "boldest 
                                  attempt yet, Jagger started writing and recording material for his first 
                                  solo album <i>She's the Boss</i>.Released on <i>19 February 1985</i>, the album, produced by <b>Nile Rodgers</b> and <b>Bill Laswell</b>, features <b>Herbie Hancock</b>, <b>Jeff Beck</b>, <b>Jan Hammer</b>, <b>Pete Townshend</b> and the <b>Compass Point All Stars</b>. It sold well, and the single <i>"Just Another Night"</i> was a Top Ten hit. During this period, he collaborated with <b>the Jacksons</b> on the 
                                  song <i>"State of Shock"</i>, sharing lead vocals with <b>Michael Jackson</b>. 
                                  Jagger performed without the Stones for the Live Aid multi-venue charity concert in <i>1985</i>. He performed at Philadelphia's JFK Stadium, including a duet with <b>Tina Turner</b> of <i>"It's Only Rock and Roll"</i> (which was highlighted by Jagger tearing away Turner's skirt) and a cover of <i>"Dancing in the Street"</i> with <b>David Bowie</b>, who was performing 
                                  at Wembley Stadium, London. The video was shown simultaneously on the screens of both Wembley and JFK Stadiums. The song reached 
                                  number one in the UK the same year. In <i>1987</i> he released his second solo album, <i>Primitive Cool</i>. While it failed to match the commercial success of his debut, it was critically well-received. In <i>1988</i> he produced the songs <i>"Glamour Boys"</i> and <i>"Which Way to America"</i> on Living Colour's album <i>Vivid</i>. Between <i>15 and 28 March</i> he did a solo concert 
                                  tour in Japan (Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka).

                                  Following the success of the Rolling Stones' <i>1989</i> comeback album, <i>Steel Wheels</i>, and the end of Jagger and Richards' well- publicised feud, Jagger attempted to re-establish himself as a solo artist. Jagger acquired <b>Rick Rubin</b> as co-producer in <i>January 1992</i> for what would become Jagger's third solo album, <i>Wandering Spirit</i>. Sessions for the album began the same month in Los Angeles and lasted over seven 
                                  months, ending in <i>September 1992</i>.During this time period, Richards was also making his second solo studio album, <i>Main Offender</i>. 
                                  On Wandering Spirit, Jagger kept celebrity guests to a minimum, only having <b>Lenny Kravitz</b> as a vocalist on his cover of <b>Bill Withers'</b> <i>"Use Me"</i> and bassist <b>Flea</b> from <i>Red Hot Chili Peppers</i> on three separate tracks. To distribute the album, Jagger signed with Atlantic Records (which had signed the Stones in the 1970s). Wandering Spirit was his only solo release with the label, with the exception of <i>The Very Best of Mick Jagger </i>– a compilation album containing no new 
                                  material. Released in <i>February 1993</i>, Wandering Spirit was 
                                  commercially successful, reaching No.12 in the UK and No.11 in the US.

                                  In <i>2001</i>, Jagger released his fourth (and final) solo album, <i>Goddess in the Doorway</i>, spawning the single <i>"Visions of Paradise"</i>, which reached 
                                  No. 43 for one week . Following the <i>11 September</i> attacks, Jagger joined Keith Richards in the Concert for New York City, a benefit concert in response to the terrorist attack, to sing <i>"Salt of the Earth"</i> and <i>"Miss You"</i>.
                                  According to Fortune, from <i>1989 to 2001</i>, the Stones generated more than US$1.5 billion in total gross revenue, exceeding that of <b>U2</b>, <b>Bruce 
                                  Springsteen</b>, or <b>Michael Jackson</b>. Jagger celebrated the Rolling Stones' 40th anniversary by touring with the band on the year-long Licks Tour, supporting their commercially successful career 
                                  retrospective Forty Licks double album. In <i>2007</i>, the band grossed US$437 million on their <i>A Bigger Bang Tour</i>, which got them into the <i>2007</i> edition of <i>Guinness World Records</i> for the most lucrative music 
                                  tour. When asked that year if the band would retire after the tour, Jagger stated that "I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours. We've got no plans to stop any of that 
                                  really."
                                  Two years later in <i>October 2009</i>, Jagger joined <b>U2</b> on stage to perform <i>"Gimme Shelter"</i> (with <b>Fergie</b> and <b>will.i.am</b>) and <i>"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of"</i> with U2 at the 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall of 
                                  Fame Concert.

                                  On <i>20 May 2011</i>, Jagger announced the formation of a new supergroup, <i>SuperHeavy</i>, which includes <b>Dave Stewart</b>, <b>Joss 
                                  Stone</b>, <b>Damian Marley</b> and <b>A.R. Rahman</b>. The group started from a phone call that Jagger received from Stewart. Stewart had heard three sound systems playing different music at the same time in his home in St Ann's Bay, Jamaica. This gave him the idea to create a group with Jagger, fusing musical styles of various artists. After multiple phone calls and deliberation, the other members of the group were decided upon. 
                                  SuperHeavy released one album and two singles in <i>2011</i>, reportedly recording 29 songs in ten days. Jagger is featured on 
                                  will.i.am's <i>2011</i> single <i>"T.H.E. (The Hardest Ever)"</i> along with <b>Jennifer Lopez</b>. It was officially released to iTunes on <i>4 February 2012</i>. 
                                  On <i>21 February 2012</i>, <b>Jagger</b>, <b>B.B. King</b>, <b>Buddy Guy</b> and <b>Jeff Beck</b>, along with a blues ensemble, performed at the White House concert series before President <b>Barack Obama</b>. When Jagger held out a mic to him, Obama twice sang the line "Come on, baby don't you want to go" of the blues cover "Sweet Home Chicago," the blues anthem of Obama's 
                                  hometown. Jagger hosted the season finale of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> on <i>19 and 20 May 2012</i>, doing several comic skits and playing some 
                                  Rolling Stones' hits with <i>Arcade Fire</i>, <i>Foo Fighters</i>, and <i>Jeff Beck</i>. Jagger performed in 12-12-12: The Concert for <b>Sandy Relief</b> with the 
                                  Rolling Stones on <i>12 December 2012</i>. The Stones finally played the Glastonbury festival in <i>2013</i>, headlining on <i>Saturday 29 June</i>. 
                                  This was followed by two concerts in London's Hyde Park as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations, their first in the Park since their 
                                  famous <i>1969</i> performance.  In <i>2013</i>, Jagger teamed up with his brother <b>Chris Jagger</b> for two new duets on his album <i>Concertina 
                                  Jack</i>, released to mark the 40th anniversary of his debut album. In <i>July 2017</i>, Jagger released the double A-sided single <i>"Gotta Get a 
                                  Grip"</i> / <i>"England Lost"</i>. They were released as a response to the "anxiety, unknowability of the changing political situation" in a post- 
                                  Brexit UK, according to Jagger. Accompanying music videos were released for both songs.
                                  In <i>March 2019</i>, a Rolling Stones tour of the U.S. and Canada, due to take place from April to June, had to be postponed as Jagger was to receive medical treatment for a then undisclosed condition, which was later said to involve a Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) 
                                  procedure. On <i>4 April 2019</i>, it was announced that Jagger had 
                                  completed his heart valve procedure in New York City, was recovering (in hospital) after a successful operation on his heart, was in great health, was getting some rest and could be released in the following few 
                                  days.After a six-week delay while Jagger recovered, the No Filter Tour resumed with two performances at Chicago's Soldier Field.
